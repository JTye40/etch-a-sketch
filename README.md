# etch-a-sketch

An attempt to re-create a basic retro etch-a-sketch

This project involved the implementation of various javascript methods and the creation of numerous functions

A grid of interactive divs were generated and are allowed to be changed in amount by the click of a button

Event listeners aid in the functionality of the buttons and allow for the random generation of an rgb value for the hover effect

This project helped to solidify various html, css, and javascript concepts, and expanded knowledge due to requirements of debugging various aspects of the code
